\begin{abstract}
  The abstract paragraph should be indented 0.25 inches on both left
  and right-hand margins.  Use 10pt (point) type, with a vertical
  spacing of 10.5 points.  ``Abstract'' must be centered, bold, and
  12pt.  Two line spaces (21pt) precede the abstract.  The abstract
  must be limited to one paragraph, maximum 200 words.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

The proceedings are the records of the conference.  To do this, we ask
that authors follow some simple guidelines.  In essence, we ask you to
make your paper look exactly like this document.  The easiest way to
do this is simply to download a template from the ISMIR 2003 web site
(\texttt{http://ismir2003.ismir.net}), and replace the content with
your own material.  The template presented here is based on Morgan
Kaufmann's two-column proceedings format, and borrows some
instructions from past ISMIR templates.

\section{Page size}

All material on each page should fit within a rectangle of 7.25"
$\times$ 9.75" (18.42cm $\times$ 24.77cm), centered on the page,
beginning 0.625" (1.59cm) from the top of the page and ending with
0.625" (1.59cm) from the bottom. The right and left margins should be
0.625" (1.59cm).  The text should be in two 3.5" (8.89cm) columns with
a 0.25" (0.64cm) gutter.

\section{Typeset text}

\subsection{Normal or Body Text}

Please use a 10pt (point) Times font, or other Roman font with serifs, as
close as possible in appearance to Times.  Please use sans-serif or
non-proportional fonts only for special purposes, such as
distinguishing source code text.

There is one half line space between paragraphs, with no indent.

\subsection{Title and Authors}

The title is 16pt Times, bold, caps, lower case, centered between 2
horizontal rules.  Both rules are 1pt thick.

Authors' names are centered.  The lead author's name is to be listed
first (left-most), and the co-authors' names after.  If the addresses
for all authors are the same, include the address only once, centered.
If the authors have different addresses, put the addresses under each
authors' name.

\subsection{First Page Copyright Notice}

Please include the copyright notice exactly as it appears here in the
lower left-hand corner of the page.  It is set in 8pt Times, with
a 0.5pt box.

\subsection{Page Numbering, Headers and Footers}

Do not include headers, footers or page numbers in your
submission. These will be added when the publications are assembled.

\section{First level headings}

First level headings are in Times 12pt bold, flush left with 1
line of space above the section head, and 1/2 space below it.  For a
section header immediately followed by a subsection header, the space
should be merged.

\subsection{Second level headings}

Second level headings are in Times 10pt bold, flush left, with 1
line of space above the section head, and 1/2 space below it.

\subsubsection{Third level headings}

Second level headings are in Times 10pt italic, flush left, with
1/2 line of space above the section head, and 1/2 space below it.

\paragraph{Fourth level headings.}

Fourth level headings must be flush left, initial caps, and Times
10pt italic, with 1/2 line of space above the section head.
Fourth level headings are not numbered, and must end in a period.

\subsection{Footnotes, Citations, and Figures}

\subsubsection{Footnotes}

Indicate footnotes with a number\footnote{Sample of first footnote} in
the text.  Use 8pt type for footnotes.  Place the footnotes at the
bottom of the page on which they appear.  Precede the footnote with a
0.5pt horizontal rule.\footnote{Sample of the second
footnote}

\subsubsection{Citations}

Citations should include the author name(s) and date.  For example,
``Hert and Marchionini (1998) found that'', or ``as found in other
studies (Hert and Marchionini, 1998; Clarke and Willett, 1997).''

Whether paraphrasing or quoting directly, the source must be
credited. For a direct quote supply page numbers.

\subsubsection{Figures, tables, and captions}

All artwork must be centered, neat, clean, and legible.  All lines
should be very dark for purposes of reproduction and art work should
not be hand-drawn.  The proceedings is not in color, and therefore all
figures must be comprehensible in black-and-white form.

Figure and table numbers and captions always appear below the figure.
Leave 1 line space between the figure or table and the caption.  Each
figure or table is numbered consecutively. Captions should be Times
10pt.

Place Tables/Figures in text should be as close to the reference as
possible (see Figure 1 and Table 1).  They may extend across both
columns to a maximum width of 7.25" (17.78cm).

% An example table
\begin{table}[htb]
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
      \hline 
      \bf Graphics & \bf Top & \bf In-between & \bf Bottom \\
      \hline
      Tables & End & Last & First \\
      \hline
      Figures & Good & Similar & Very well \\
      \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Table captions should be placed below the table}
  \end{center}
\end{table}

% An example figure
\begin{figure}[htb] 
  \vspace{1.5in}
