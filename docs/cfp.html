4th International Conference on Music Information

October 26-30, 2003<br />
Library of Congress, Washington, D.C., USA, and<br />
Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, USA<br />
<br /><br />
Call for <a href="#papers">Papers</a>, <a href="#posters">Posters</a>,

<br />
<h2>Please Note: The deadline has passed for all submissions.</h2>
</div>
<div id="content">
The annual ISMIR Conference is the first established international
forum for those involved in work on accessing digital musical
materials. It reflects the tremendous growth of music-related data
available either locally or remotely through networks and the
consequent need to search this content and retrieve music and musical
information efficiently and effectively.
<br /><br />
This area presents vast challenges for those who need to organize and
structure musical data, provide tools to search and retrieve, and use
these tools efficiently. Music representation needs to be multi-
dimensional and time-dependent; audio data is voluminous, requiring
particular care in storage and transmission while preserving quality;
the need for descriptive information about what is musically
significant addresses a large spectrum of internal and external
characteristics, from acoustic to musicological and cultural features;
intellectual property rights issues (about what can be made available
to whom and how) are complex, involve a variety of individuals and
organizations, and vary from country to country.
<br /><br />
All of these concerns are of interest to education, academia,
entertainment and industry. This conference thus aims at providing a
place for the exchange of news, issues and results, by bringing
together researchers and developers, educators and librarians,
students and professional users, working in fields that contribute
significantly to this multidisciplinary domain, to present original
theoretical or practical work in peer-reviewed contributions (papers,
posters). It will also serve as a discussion forum (panels), provide
introductory and in-depth information in specific domains (tutorials),
and show current products (exhibits).
<br /><br />
<strong>Domains and Topics of Interest</strong>
<br /><br />
ISMIR 2003 solicits original contributions in the following domains,
as they apply to music information retrieval(this is a non-exclusive
list):<br />
<ul>
<li> Algorithms and methods for classification, clustering,
  probabilistic modelling, association analysis</li>
<li> Artificial intelligence and Machine Learning</li>
<li>Databases and data mining</li>
<li>Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and systems design</li>
<li>Intellectual property rights issues,</li>
<li>Knowledge representation, discovery and acquisition</li>
<li>Music perception and cognition</li>
<li>Music representation and formal models of music</li>
<li>Soft computing (neural networks, fuzzy systems, evolutionary
computation)</li>
</ul>
<br />
Typical topics of interest, inasmuch as they relate to music
information retrieval, are:
<br />
<ul>
<li>Automatic summarization, citing, excerpting, downgrading,
  transformation (including associated intellectual property issues)</li>
<li>Business models and experience</li>
<li>Formal models of music and their digital representations</li>
<li>Intellectual property rights issues (nationally and internationally),
  digital rights management, identification and traceability</li>
<li>Music digital libraries and archives,
  content management systems and frameworks for music</li>
<li>Music indexing and metadata (authoring and generation)</li>
<li>Music recognition (printed, audio)</li>
<li>Music representation, coding, language modelling</li>
<li>Music similarity metrics (perceptual criteria such as pitch, rhythm,
  timbre; musical criteria such as form, genre, etc.)</li>
<li>Musical styles and genres</li>
<li>Query languages for music IR (expressiveness, complexity)</li>
<li>Real-time applications of automated music identification and
  recognition, such as score following, automatic accompaniment</li>
<li>Routing and filtering for music and music queries</li>
<li>Semantic Web and musical digital objects: intelligent agents,
  ontologies, topic maps, metadata, indexation, markup languages</li>
<li>Socio-cultural aspects</li>
<li>Standards (RDF, XML, INDECS, MPEG, Dublin Core, *MARC, Z39.50...) and
  other metadata or protocols for music information handling and
  retrieval (CDDB, ...)</li>
<li>Systems issues (performance, compression, scalability, databases,
  architecture, distributed search, multi-agent systems, mobile
  applications)</li>
<li> User interfaces and usability</li>
<li>Validation (user needs and expectations, evaluation of music IR
  systems, building test collections, experimental design and 
metrics)</li> <br />
<a href="#top">Back to Top</a></ul>
<br />
