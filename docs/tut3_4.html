<strong>
Tutorial III<br />
Music IR 201: Music Retrieval and Analysis<br />
Presenter: Arbee Chen<br />
2:00 to 5:00 p.m.</strong><br />
<p>
In this tutorial, we introduce various techniques for content-based music 
retrieval and analysis. The issues of music representation, similarity 
measure, index construction, query processing, and music analysis will be 
discussed. The features considered to represent music can be its 
acoustical properties, themes, melody, rhythm, chord, contour, etc. The 
suffix-tree based, n-gram based and list based index structures are most 
often used indexing schemes that will be detailed. The processing of 
incipit queries, non-incipit queries and approximate queries, as well as 
the consideration of an adequate similarity measure will be presented. The 
approaches for processing monophonic and polyphonic music will be 
surveyed. The performance analysis including efficiency and effectiveness 
of query processing and the performance measures will be also introduced. 
Various ways of music analysis using data mining techniques including 
sequential pattern discovery, repeating pattern discovery and 
classification and clustering will be presented. Music phrase 
segmentation, music sentence identification, association of pieces of 
determine the structures of music for music retrieval or music
classification and clustering for applications such as music
recommendation. Architecture for music recommendation will be also
introduced.</p>

<strong>Tutorial IV<br />
Sound, Symbol, and Idea: Three Approaches to Music Query<br />
Presenters: Eleanor Selfridge-Field and Craig Stuart Sapp<br />
2:00 to 5:00 p.m.</strong><br />
The aim of this tutorial is to view current lines of research in the
broader context of the ordinary activities of scholars, musicians, and
theorists. On the one hand, those developing audio-based applications may
benefit from a grounded knowledge of the tools in common use in these
communities. On the other, audio researchers are increasingly looking to
music scholarship to bring definition to concepts and procedures. Because
there is little communication between audio-based and symbol-based
approaches, with even less uptake of schematic views of music, it seems
timely to examine areas in which the sharing of expertise could benefit
all parties.</p>
