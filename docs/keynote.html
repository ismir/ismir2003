ISMIR 2003 Keynote Address<br />
(Speaker) Anthony Seeger<br />
(Title) <em>"I Found It, How Can I Use It? - Dealing With the Ethical and Legal 
Constraints of Information Access"</em><br />
</p>
<br />
<strong>Abstract:</strong><br />
It is easy to find music on the Internet today, but how it may be used 
is the source of considerable conflict, front-page news stories, and increasing 
scholarly reflection.  One of the frustrations for libraries, archives, and
patrons alike is the gulf between information about a holding and actual
access to it.  But users are not the only ones to be concerned about access.
Local musicians feel everyone profits from their cultural heritage but they 
themselves; researchers find themselves held responsible for research
recordings made decades earlier and largely forgotten; and some communities  
seek protection in existing legislation on trade secrets or by writing new
legislation.  Caught in the middle between angry users and angry producers,   
what are people who want improved access to musical collections to do? This  
paper proposes a number of things music librarians and other information     
professionals might consider in order to help users find what they can while
at the same time educating them in the issues behind the frustrating
restrictions.
<br /><br />
