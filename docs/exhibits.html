<strong><em>EXHIBITING AT ISMIR</em></strong>
<br /><br />
The annual ISMIR 2003 is the first established international forum for 
those involved in work on accessing digital musical materials. It reflects 
the tremendous growth of music-related data available either locally or 
remotely through networks and the consequent need to search this content 
and retrieve music and musical information efficiently and effectively. 
This conference brings together researchers and developers, educators and 
librarians, students and professional users, working in fields that 
contribute significantly to this multi-disciplinary domain, to present 
original theoretical or practical work in peer-reviewed contributions. 
Past conferences included over 200 participants representing 22 countries.
<br /><br />
